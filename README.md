# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for arch linux and i3wm.

(stuff here might changes, break and be not useful at all for you, 
  it's recommended to only use this as a reference)

## Tool used 

The main tool used to manage the dotfiles is [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Installation

To install the dotfiles, clone the repository and use stow to symlink the files to the home directory.

```bash
git clone 
cd dotfiles
stow .
```

## Notes

my neovim config and emacs config are in dedicated repositories if you are looking for that.
